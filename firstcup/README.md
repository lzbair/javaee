# Architecture

- Web tier component: JavaServer Faces application packaged into firstcup-war.  
- Three business tier components: DukesAgeResource web service, FirstcupUser JPA entity, DukesBirthdayBean ejb.  
- Enterprise information system (EIS) tier: data in the Apache Derby database table. 
- The userâ€™s web browser is the client tier component, as it accesses the rest of the application through the web tier.

# Packaging / Deployment
- JSF application + DukesBirthdayBean ejb + FirstcupUser JPA entity: will be packaged in one war.
- JAX-RS DukesAgeResource: will be packaged (and can be depoyed) separately.
Notice that the war application is actually a javaee client for DukesAgeResource.
